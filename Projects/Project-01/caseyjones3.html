		<h3> Ok, all aboard y’all. Let’s get this party started, or, I mean, this train uh, a movin, real fast!
		</h3>
		<p>
			<mark> Wow the world really is a beautiful place when you’re in motion. I feel so comfortable being an observer watching as life unfolds all around me while always maintaining a safe distance from serious emotional commitment. It's as if I was born to be a passenger and place my fate in the hands of someone else. Powerless I feel at peace with the world.
